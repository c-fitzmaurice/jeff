            <p class="mb-4 leading-loose text-lg">It has been a real pleasure and an honor over the years having had the privilege of creating illustrations for many of the highest profile companies, advertising agencies and publishers in the country.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-loose text-lg">That experience has also given me the enjoyable opportunity to work for and collaborate with many very talented art directors and designers to whom I owe thanks and appreciation for the opportunity and trust.</p>
